'''A most simple sample for GCGB and GCB.
'''------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program blinks the onboard LED of a microcontroller - simple.
'''
'''This sample file can be adapted to any of the supported microcontrollers
'''by simply changing the #chip creating and removing the comment.
'''
'''To make your programmer or your bootloader work, simply do the following.
'''
'''From within this IDE, select from the menu 'IDE Tools/GCB Tools/Edit Programmer Preferences' or press Ctrl-Alt-E.
'''this will show you the 'Programmer Preferences', select the 'Programmer' tab.
'''
'''For PIC:  Typically, if you are using a PICKIT2 then 'Microchip PICKit 2 CLI - Default' will work for you.
'''For AVR:  Typically, for an UNO the programmer 'Arduino UNO/328p@115200' will work - but, please edit the communication 'PORT'.
'''then, select OK to save your changes.

'''Enjoy.
